        <h1>Exploring Dhulikhel</h1>
        <p>The meaning of 'Dhulikhel' means 'the place where tigers play'. Nearly one hour ride with quite a big road in comparision to other 
         outlets of the Kathmandu Valley, Dhulikhel recides in the Kavrepalanchowk District as it faces the backside of the tallest statue
         of Nepal, Kailashnath Mahadev Statue. Probably the best visit for a night stay chilling with friends or a beautiful ride back, 
         Dhulikhel has a lot to offer as it attracts local and international tourists.</p> 
        <p>Dhulikhel has been there for centuries as an important trading centre on the commercial route linking Nepal 
         to Tibet. This is the reason why it has been the home for beautiful old architectures and cuturally rich scluptures and temples.</p>

        <h2>Must Visit Dhulikhel</h2>
        <p>The name itself clearifies the naturally beautiful Dhulikhel, which means 'the place where tigers play'. A panorama view of around 20
        mountain peaks can be seen which also includes  Mt. Lhotse (8516 m), Langtang (7234 m),  Mt. Gaurishanker (7134 m), Phuribichyachu (6637 m) 
        and many more.</p>

        <section id="selfi"><h3>Selfi Stone or Kali Temple</h3>
            <p>
                Just a short hike to the hilltop of Dhulikhel, you’ll find the Kali Temple. The temple is for Goddess Kali, who is an epitome of
                 destruction and power. Close to the temple you can find the famous ‘selfie stone’ which is famous for tourists to capture their 
                 adventure. They pretend to hang off what appears in the photos as a rock ledge, but really if they let go, they would return to 
                 the earth quite quick. The impressive views of the Himalayas, green hills and the ethnic settlements offer you a wonderful memory.

            <p>
                Namobuddha Monastery is known to be one of the most sacred sites for Buddhists around the world and one of the most significant 
                monastic destinations among three in Nepal. It is beautifully situated on the hilltop of Kavre district, offering spiritual 
                environment, rich architectures and impressive views of hills and Himalayas.
            </p>
                <p> Namo Buddha received its name from the historical 
                stories told. It is believed that a prince gave his life, his bones buried in the local village in a stupa. 3500 years later, 
                Gautam Buddha visited the village and led three tours around the stupa declaring that he was a reincarnation of the prince. So, 
                in his name, the village was renamed to Namo Buddha meaning homage to Buddha.
